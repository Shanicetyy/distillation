For a general stage :math:`j`,
the energy balance is

.. math::

    L_j h_j + V_jH_j = V_{j+1}H_{j+1} + L_{j-1}h_{j-1} + F_j h_{j,\mathrm{feed}} + Q_j

The liquid flow rates can be substituted in using the following relationship

.. math::

    L_k = V_{k+1} - D + \sum_{m=0}^k F_m

So that the system of equations only becomes functions of :math:`V_j` and :math:`V_{j+1}`.
